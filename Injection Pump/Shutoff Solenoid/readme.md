>If the solenoid is bad, the car won't start, because fuel won't be sent to the delivery pipes.  
>My solenoid was blowing the 16 amp fuse, 3rd from the bottom.  
>After measuring with a multimeter, I found my resistance to be 0.9 ohms, which is about 10% of what it should be, thereby causing too much current to flow, explaining the blown fuse.    
>After replacing the solenoid, my reading was about 10 ohms.  
>My other diesel reads 7.7 ohms.  
>Anything under 5 ohms may probably indicate a failing solenoid.
